#  Good Music Listicle

This is a listicle of actual **Good Music** so obviously no country music will be listed here. While these are my opinions they are objectively correct and not up for negotiation. They are listed in order from **greatest** to **least great** so just being on the list is an incredible honor.

1. [**Hole**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hole/115269)
Known to most as just Kurt Cobain's wife's band, Hole is an incredible grunge band led by Courtney Love, a woman who has experienced so much privilege and so much pain, such that no one can match her anger. While only 2 of her band's 4 albums are any good, those 2 albums (Celebrity Skin and Live Through This) have earned her the title of Queen of Grunge and are packed with powerful and infuriating songs.
